### Welcome to my libASM repository 👋

⭐️ The goal of this subject was to recode few functions in assembly language (64 bits ASM - Intel syntax).

## 💡 Usage
- My assembly code compiles with nasm.

```
make
gcc main.c libasm.a
./a.out
```

✅ You can check if there are differences between my functions and the real ones with these tests.
